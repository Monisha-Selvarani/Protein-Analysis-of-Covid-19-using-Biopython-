# Protein-Analysis-of-Covid-19-using-Biopython-

1. In this project, I will be exploring the DNA sequence of Covid 19 using Biopython, which is a powerful bioinformatics package.
2. Initially, I used my sample DNA sequence by doing some analysis to perform Protein synthesis(Transcription and Translation) that I had attached in my jupyter notebook for reference.
3. For the main task, I downloaded the SARS virus from the NCBI website to perform Protein synthesis. And also I used Pandas, which is the library of Python to create a data frame regarding the amino acids.
4. For visualizing the 3D structure of Covid, I used to install the nglview and py3Dmol packages
