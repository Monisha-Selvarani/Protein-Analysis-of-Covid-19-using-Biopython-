# Protein-Analysis-of-Covid-19-using-Biopython-

1. In this project, I will be exploring the DNA sequence of Covid-19 using Biopython, Pandas and Jupyter.
2. Initially, I used a sample DNA sequence by doing some analysis to perform Protein synthesis(Transcription and Translation).
3. For the main task, I downloaded the SARS virus from the NCBI website to perform Protein synthesis. Also I used Pandas, which is the library of Python to create a data    frame regarding the amino acids and performed various statistical analysis.
4. I used the nglview and py3Dmol packages, for visualizing the 3D structure of Covid.
